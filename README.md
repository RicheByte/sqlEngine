## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RicheByte/sqlEngine.git
cd sqlEngine

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- `requests` - HTTP client for web requests
- `urllib3` - URL handling and SSL management

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Scan
```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.py` to customize your scan:

```python
# Target configuration
TARGET_URL = "http://example.com/vulnerable-page.php"
TEST_PARAMS = ["id", "category", "user"]  # Parameters to test

# Engine configurations
TIME_DELAY_THRESHOLD = 3  # Seconds for time-based detection
BOOLEAN_DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # Content difference threshold
MAX_PAYLOADS_PER_TEST = 50  # Payloads per engine
```

### Command Line Options
For advanced usage, you can modify `main.py` to accept command-line arguments:

```python
# Example enhancement for command-line support
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='SQL Injection Automator')
parser.add_argument('--url', help='Target URL')
parser.add_argument('--params', help='Comma-separated parameters to test')
args = parser.parse_args()
```

##  Advanced Configuration

### Custom Payloads
Add your own payloads to the text files in the `payloads/` directory:

```bash
# Add custom boolean payloads
echo "custom' OR '1'='1" >> payloads/boolean_payloads.txt

# Add custom time-based payloads  
echo "'; SELECT pg_sleep(10)--" >> payloads/time_payloads.txt
```

### HTTP Client Configuration
Modify `utils/http_client.py` for advanced HTTP settings:

```python
# Custom headers
self.session.headers.update({
    'User-Agent': 'Custom-Scanner/1.0',
    'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
})

# Proxy support
self.session.proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy:8080',
    'https': 'https://proxy:8080'
}
```

##  Report Generation

The tool generates comprehensive HTML reports with:

- **Executive Summary**: Vulnerability counts and risk assessment
- **Detailed Findings**: Specific payloads and evidence for each vulnerability
- **Scan Metadata**: Timing information and target details
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly report layout

Sample report location: `scan_report.html`

##  Security Features

### Safe Testing Practices
- Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Retry logic for unreliable network conditions
- SSL verification options for testing environments
- Payload limits to prevent excessive requests

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling across all modules
- Graceful degradation when payload files are missing
- Connection testing before full scan execution

## üîç Detection Methodology

### Boolean-Based Detection
- Compares response lengths between true/false conditions
- Uses configurable difference thresholds (default: 30%)
- Tests multiple quote types and comment syntaxes

### Time-Based Detection  
- Measures response delays for sleep-based payloads
- Supports database-specific timing functions
- Handles timeout exceptions as potential indicators

### Union-Based Detection
- Tests various column counts and data types
- Detects database error messages and content changes
- Identifies successful data extraction attempts

### Error-Based Detection
- Analyzes database error messages in responses
- Uses pattern matching for different database systems
- Detects information disclosure through error messages

pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
```

**Payload File Issues:**
```python
# Tool will use built-in payloads if files are missing
# Check file permissions and paths
```

### Debug Mode
Add debug output by modifying engine classes:

```python
# In any engine file, add:
print(f"   Testing payload: {payload}")
print(f"   Response length: {len(response)}")
```

##  Extending the Tool

### Adding New Engines
1. Create new engine in `engines/` directory
2. Implement the `test()` method
3. Add to engine list in `main.py`

### Custom Payload Formats
Support different payload formats by modifying payload loading:

```python
def _load_payloads(self):
    # Support JSON, YAML, or database sources
    with open('payloads/custom.json') as f:
        return json.load(f)['payloads']
```
